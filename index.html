    <h1>Associative Memory</h1>
    
    <p>Uses perdeterminded patterns of sign flipping followed by the fast Walsh Hadamard transform to create Random Projections (RPs.)</p>
    <p>The RPs are then binarized to give a Locality Sensitive Hash.</p>
    <p>The bits of the hash are regarded as +1 or -1, weighted and summed to give a recalled value.</p>
    <p>This is done in as many dimensions as wanted.  To train, a recall is done and the error calculated.</p>
    <p>The error is divided by the number of bits used and that is added or subtracted from each weight as appropriate to make the error zero.</p>
    <p>The effect on previously stored memories to to contaminate them with some Gaussian noise.</p>
    <p>By repeated training on the examples the Gaussian noise can be driven to zero if the capacity of the AM is big enough.<p>
